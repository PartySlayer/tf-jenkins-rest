Introduction

Hi everyone, this project demonstrates the deployment of a Python API web application on AWS, utilizing Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) and Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

The project is divided into two repositories:

Infrastructure Repository (you are currently here): Contains the Terraform configuration files for setting up the AWS infrastructure.
Webapp Repository ([click here to visit]([url](https://github.com/PartySlayer/flask-api-jenkins/))): Contains the Python API development and Jenkinsfile for CI/CD pipeline configuration.
